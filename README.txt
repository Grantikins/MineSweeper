This is a recreation of MineSweeper in java using javafx. In order to run this, you will need to 
download javafx here: https://openjfx.io/  Save it somewhere to remember, then cd into the directory containing 
the MineSweeper.jar file and run this command:  

java --module-path "Path\to\javafx_lib folder"
 --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar MineSweeper.jar 

This will run the program.
